This portfolio is based off of the second assignment completed as a part of the *UT Austin Coding Boot Camp*.

We were tasked with making a mobile responsive website (w/o Bootstrap) using media queires with @media screen tags @ 980px, 768px abd 640px.

Orginally this website had three separate HTML pages for the About Me, Portfolio and Contact sections. Identical to my previous Portfolio assignments. 

However, I decided to revise and make single page site utilizing a href links to specific content containers on the page for navigation links to point to.

### Learned:

* Media queries
* The need for viewport tag in HTML
* Chrome Extensions; Window Resizer and Browser Width
* Font Awesome CDN
* Adjusting size of Font Awesome icons
